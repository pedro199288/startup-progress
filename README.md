# STARTUP PROGRESS

This project has been built using [Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev/).

Is a little app that stores the progress of a startup in the browser local storage. It has been built using the react pattern "Compund components" (see more here ðŸ‘‰ https://kentcdodds.com/blog/compound-components-with-react-hooks)

This pattern gives more flexibility to modify the component UI while keeping the same functionality shared via React context.

## Develop

To start development on this project, simply run `npm install` in the root folder and then `npm start`, the app will be served in http://localhost:3000.

## Deploy

There is no specific implementation for deploying this project, you can simply run `npm run build` to build the project and upload the resulting folder (`build`) to any static web hosting service (e.g. Netlify).
